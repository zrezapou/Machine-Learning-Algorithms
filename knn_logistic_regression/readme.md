- Implementation of K-nearest neighbours and cross validation from scratch for classification task using Python. Classifying each input x according to the most frequent
class amongst its k nearest neighbours as measured by the Euclidean distance (L2-norm). Determining the best number of neighbours k by cross validation.


- Implementation of Mixture of Gaussians and learning the parameters π, µ1, µ2 and Σ by likelihood maximization using Bayes theorem to compute the probability of each class.


- Implementation of Logistic regression and learning the parameters w and w0 by conditional likelihood maximization. More specifically using Newton’s algorithm to optimize the parameters.


- The dataset is a modified version of the Optical Recognition of Handwritten Digits Dataset from the UCI repository. It contains pre-processed black and white images of the digits 5 and 6. Each attribute indicates how many pixels are black in a patch of 4 x 4 pixels.
